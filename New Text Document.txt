Was written to port an from MBCS to UNICODE and to Internationalize the text at the same time.
Reads in resource file then computes new text/caption lengths which are 1.5 times the English 
text/caption then goes through and resizes the edit boxes and captions in Dialogs. Once they
are resized figures out if the dialog needs resizing too and performs resizing.

The last part is where I left off so it just needs to recompute new dialog sizing if other controls
changed size.


This code can also be used for any other language where a file or files can be parsed and its has the idea of dialogs, pages, controls and text.
Can laso be used for what ever else you'd want to parse into these specific definitions.
